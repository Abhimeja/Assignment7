    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called an object.\n",
    "It allows for the hiding of internal data and implementation details, providing access to the object's functionality through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, security, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties (attributes and methods) of another class.\n",
    "The class that is being inherited from is called the superclass or base class, and the class that inherits is called the subclass or derived class.\n",
    "Inheritance promotes code reusability and allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where the subclass inherits and extends the functionality\n",
    "of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It refers to the ability of an object\n",
    "to take on many forms or have multiple behaviors. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows\n",
    "a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method already defined in its superclass, while method overloading allows multiple methods with\n",
    "the same name but different parameters to coexist in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential features and hiding the unnecessary details. It allows programmers to focus on the relevant aspects of an object and ignore its implementation complexities. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define a set of methods without providing their implementation. By using abstraction, you can create generic and reusable components that can be extended and implemented by subclasses to provide specific functionality."
